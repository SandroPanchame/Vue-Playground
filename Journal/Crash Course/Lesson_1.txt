For some reason the css doesn't work. 
Fixed it by re-writing the location for the style sheet in the html file. 
The name wasn't changed, but somehow it worked?

lol, it was styles.css, not style.css

The reviews don't get saved anywhere.

The course showed circle buttons, edited .color-box in style.css
