> data() vs data: function()
    - You use data() so that the same data object is 
    not shared between other child components, which can lead to bugs.
    - There doesn't seem to be a real difference between the two?
    - data() -> es6 shorthand for data: function()

> es6
    - ecma script
    - standardization of javascript

    - will have to fork and switch branches of the original code to have a starter
    - kind of sucks, but what ever. Need to be able to follow along
